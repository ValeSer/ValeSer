<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Valeria! Welcome to my GitHub CV</h1> 

<h3 align="center">Previously a Nanny. Now a Software Engineer. </h3>

If you are wondering why I decided to switch careers from working with lovely kids to working with coding....I will tell you in a second!

With a background in hospitality and childcare, my journey into coding started as a curiosity nurtured by friends and family.
</br> **2019** was a special year for me: I found out I was expecting my amazing son, and having helped unblock some software developer friends during our hangouts, I felt my journey into software development had to **begin**!
For the past 5 years, I've pursued courses and immersive experiences:
 - Complemented my practical experience with **Codecademy certifications** in CSS, Ruby, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, and Command Line, underscoring my commitment to continuous learning and professional development.
- Attended a 16-week Software Development Bootcamp at **Makers Academy**.
- Led an 8-member team in a 6-week program during **Chingu Voyage 46**, where I honed my technical and leadership skills.
- Worked on personal projects, which can be found in more detail by reading my [CV](https://github.com/ValeSer/CV).
